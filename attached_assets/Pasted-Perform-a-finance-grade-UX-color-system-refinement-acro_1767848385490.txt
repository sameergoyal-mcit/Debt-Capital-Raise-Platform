Perform a finance-grade UX + color system refinement across the app, using debt-process terminology (use “Lender Presentation”, NOT “CIM”).

====================================================
1) Global Color System (Institutional)
====================================================

- Replace any bright/saturated colors with muted finance-safe palette.
- Standardize status colors everywhere via a shared map:
  - COMPLETE = muted green (#166534)
  - PENDING = muted amber (#92400E)
  - BLOCKED/MISSING = muted red (#7F1D1D)
  - INFO = slate (#334155)

Create client/src/lib/status-colors.ts and client/src/lib/status-chips.ts and apply to all badges/chips.

====================================================
2) Tables & Scannability
====================================================

- Reduce heavy gridlines; use subtle row striping.
- Add left-border priority markers for rows (Investor Book / Execution table):
  - Red border: action required (blocking)
  - Amber border: deadline soon
  - Gray: informational
- Use tabular numeric font for all numeric columns:
  spreads, OID, fees, amounts, commitments, leverage, rates.

====================================================
3) Button Hierarchy (3-level)
====================================================

- Use only:
  - Primary (filled muted blue): submit/send core actions (Submit Commitment, Send Reminder)
  - Secondary (outline): navigation (View Docs, View Q&A)
  - Destructive (text red): withdraw/remove
- Remove filled secondary buttons and unnecessary icons.

====================================================
4) Deal Stage Progress Indicator
====================================================

- Add a horizontal deal stage progress component and show on all deal pages.
- Stages are debt stages (not equity):
  NDA → Lender Presentation → IOI → Bookbuilding → Docs → Signing → Funding
- Completed stages: green check
- Current: blue highlight
- Future: gray

====================================================
5) Action Required Strip Polish
====================================================

- Make Action Required bar compact, light amber background, dark text.
- Avoid red unless truly blocking.
- Show 1–3 items max with “View” links to the right page.

====================================================
6) Document Folder Naming
====================================================

In investor VDR, ensure folders use debt terminology:
- Lender Presentation
- Supplemental Information
- KYC & Compliance
- Lender Paydown Model
- Legal (Read-only + upload markups)

Remove any occurrence of “CIM”.

====================================================
7) Trust Signals
====================================================

Add a subtle footer line on deal pages:
- “Access logged · NDA enforced · Role-based permissions active”
Investor view also adds:
- “You only see your own submissions and questions.”

Ensure the UI remains conservative/institutional and consistent across screens.
