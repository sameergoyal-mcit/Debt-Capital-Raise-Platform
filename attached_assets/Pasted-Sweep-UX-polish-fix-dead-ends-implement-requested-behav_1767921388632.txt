Sweep UX polish + fix dead ends + implement requested behavior:

A) Typography cleanup (finance-grade)
B) Analytics: rename CIM→LP stage + deal-level drilldowns for funnel/sensitivity/mix
C) Action buttons: implement Send Reminders modal (editable email + targeting + send)
D) Remove remaining “CIM” references in UI copy

====================================================
A) TYPOGRAPHY / UI SWEEP (FINANCE-GRADE)
====================================================

1) Standardize typography scale (reduce oversized headers):
- Page H1: use text-2xl (not text-3xl) and font-semibold (not extra-bold)
- Card titles: text-base or text-lg, consistent across pages
- Body: default text-sm
- Secondary labels: text-xs with tracking-wider only for section labels

2) Apply tabular numbers where appropriate:
- For money / bps / multiples: add "tabular-nums" class to value containers.

3) Reduce visual noise:
- Remove excessive font-serif usage on numeric metrics; keep serif only for brand title or 1–2 hero headings max.

Implementation:
- Create utility CSS classes or ensure consistent Tailwind usage across:
  deal-overview.tsx, deals.tsx, analytics.tsx, documents.tsx, investor dashboard pages.

====================================================
B) ANALYTICS TAB CHANGES
====================================================

1) Rename CIM → LP (Lender Presentation) in all analytics funnel usage
- In client/src/pages/analytics.tsx:
  funnelData currently has { stage: "CIM", ... }
  Change to:
    stage: "LP" (or "Lender Presentation")
  Also update the title:
    “Investor Conversion Funnel” should show LP stage (not CIM).
- Ensure any other “CIM” strings in analytics are removed.

2) Add deal-level drilldown (hover/click) for:
- Investor Conversion Funnel
- Pricing Sensitivity
- Lender Mix
(and any other major chart cards you listed)

Required behavior:
- Default view: “All Deals” aggregated.
- On hover or click of each chart card:
  allow user to select a specific deal and view that metric by deal.

Implementation approach (simple, effective):
A) Add a Deal selector at top of Analytics:
- Dropdown: All Deals + each deal name
- Store selectedDealId in state.
- If selectedDealId != "all": filter the chart datasets to that deal only.
- Add a “Breakdown” link on each card header that opens a modal.

B) Add a modal “Breakdown by Deal”:
- Clicking on “Investor Conversion Funnel” card header (or “Breakdown”) opens Dialog with:
  - Deal dropdown
  - Table showing the metric for each deal (rows: deal, columns: stages or band buckets)
  - Optional mini chart per deal

C) Data source:
- If you have real deals in DB, fetch from /api/deals and /api/analytics?dealId=
- If analytics is still mocked, restructure mock data like:
  const analyticsByDeal = {
    [dealId]: { funnelData: [...], pricingBandData: [...], lenderMixData: [...] }
  }
Then the selector switches between aggregated and per-deal sets.
(Do not leave it purely aggregate without the selector.)

====================================================
C) FIX ACTION BUTTONS: SEND REMINDERS MODAL (DEAL OVERVIEW)
====================================================

1) Replace “Send Reminders” click behavior in client/src/pages/deal-overview.tsx:
Current behavior is toast + hardcoded emailService.send() to all-investors@deal.com.
Change to:
- Open a Dialog modal “Send Reminders”

2) Modal requirements:
Fields:
- Audience targeting (dropdown or multi-select):
   - All invited lenders
   - Missing NDA
   - No commitment submitted
   - Unviewed key docs (LP/Legal)
- Optional: select specific lenders (multi-select)
- Subject (editable input)
- Email body (editable textarea, seeded with a template)
- Buttons:
   - Preview
   - Send (primary)
   - Cancel

3) Send behavior:
- On Send:
  - Call a backend endpoint (or mock) to “send reminders”
    POST /api/deals/:id/reminders
    payload: { recipientLenderIds, subject, bodyHtml/bodyText }
  - Show success toast with count of recipients
  - Create audit logs for SEND_REMINDER (one per batch) and optionally “REMINDER_SENT” per lender

4) Backend endpoint:
- Implement /api/deals/:id/reminders:
  - Ensure issuer/bookrunner only.
  - Determine recipients based on filter OR provided lender ids.
  - If email integration exists, send; else mock-send and return {sentCount}.
  - Log audit record(s).

====================================================
D) REMOVE REMAINING CIM REFERENCES (GLOBAL)
====================================================

Search and replace remaining “CIM” user-facing strings:
- client/src/pages/analytics.tsx funnel stage “CIM” -> “LP”
- client/src/pages/deal-overview.tsx chart labels where it says 'CIM'
- client/src/pages/publish.tsx body copy referencing CIM -> “Lender Presentation” or “LP”

Important:
- Keep internal enum DealStage.CIM if you want, but all displayed labels must be “Lender Presentation” / “LP”.
- Prefer changing DealStage enum key from CIM to LP only if it won’t break stored data. If unsure, keep enum but change label text.

====================================================
VALIDATION
====================================================

- Analytics shows LP stage not CIM.
- Analytics has a Deal selector and each major chart can drill down by deal (via selector and/or modal).
- Send Reminders opens modal and sends (mock or real), with recipients targeting.
- No dead action buttons remain in Deal Overview header.
- Typography feels consistent and more institutional across pages.
