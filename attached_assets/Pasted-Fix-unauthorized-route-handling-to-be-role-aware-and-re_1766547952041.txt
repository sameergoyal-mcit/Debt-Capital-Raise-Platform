Fix unauthorized route handling to be role-aware and redirect instead of showing NotFound.

====================================================
1) Define Unauthorized Redirect Logic
====================================================
Create a helper function (or inline logic):

- If role === "investor":
    redirect to "/investor"
- If role === "issuer" or "bookrunner":
    redirect to "/deals"

This redirect should be used whenever access is denied due to role or deal access,
NOT for truly unknown routes.

====================================================
2) Update ProtectedRoute / RequireRole Components
====================================================
Wherever a route guard currently does one of the following:
- returns <NotFound />
- falls through to NotFound when role is not allowed

Change behavior to:
- use <Redirect to={getUnauthorizedRedirect(role)} />

Do NOT treat authorization failure as a 404.

====================================================
3) Deal Access Enforcement
====================================================
When accessing /deal/:id/*:

- If role is issuer or bookrunner:
    allow access if deal exists
- If role is investor:
    - If dealId is NOT in investor.dealAccess:
        redirect to "/investor"
    - If dealId is allowed BUT page is not investor-safe:
        redirect to "/investor/deal/:id"

====================================================
4) Investor-Safe Landing
====================================================
Ensure investor-safe deal landing exists:
- /investor/deal/:id

Use this as the redirect target for:
- investors trying to access /deal/:id/overview
- investors trying to access /deal/:id/book
- investors trying to access /deal/:id/analytics
- investors trying to access /deal/:id/viewer

====================================================
5) Preserve True 404 Behavior
====================================================
Only show <NotFound /> when:
- Route does not exist at all
- AND user is authenticated
- AND route is not an internal restricted page

====================================================
6) UX Verification
====================================================
After changes:
- Typing internal URLs as investor never shows "Page not available"
- Investor always lands on either:
    /investor
    or /investor/deal/:id
- Issuer/bookrunner behavior unchanged

Ensure app compiles and routing works correctly in Replit.
