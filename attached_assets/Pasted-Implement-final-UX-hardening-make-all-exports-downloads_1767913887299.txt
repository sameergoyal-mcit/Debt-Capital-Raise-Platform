Implement final UX hardening: make all exports/downloads/uploads functional, fix Documents filtering, wire calendar, and improve Closing Checklist for issuer.

1) EXPORT BUTTONS MUST DOWNLOAD FILES
- Ensure all Export buttons produce a real download using Blob + URL.createObjectURL:
  - Q&A export CSV respects role scoping (investor: only their Q&A; issuer/bookrunner: all)
  - Documents export CSV respects current filters + role visibility
- Use safe CSV escaping (quotes/newlines) and include deal name + timestamp in filename.

2) DOWNLOAD BUTTONS MUST DOWNLOAD FILES
- For documents with fileRef/url -> download actual file
- For mock docs without file -> download a placeholder .txt stating doc name/version (never dead button)

3) UPLOAD BUTTON MUST OPEN A MODAL AND CREATE DOC ENTRIES
- In Documents page:
  - Upload opens a Dialog allowing:
    file picker (pdf,xls,xlsx,csv,doc,docx)
    category (Lender Presentation, Supplemental, KYC & Compliance, Lender Paydown Model, Legal, Closing)
    type (Financial, Legal, Model, Other)
    visibility tier (early/full/legal) for issuer/bookrunner
  - On submit:
    store uploaded file metadata (fileRef/object URL ok)
    append a new Document row immediately
    mark as NEW/UPDATED for investor views and notifications
- Investor upload remains limited to Legal markups only.

4) FILTER BUTTON MUST APPLY FILTERS TO DOCUMENT LIST
- Documents page currently shows accessibleDocs but does not apply filters from DocumentFilterPanel.
- Implement applyDocumentFilters(accessibleDocs, filters) to filter by:
  - categories (multi)
  - types (multi)
  - visibility
  - dateRange
  - showNewUpdatedOnly
  - showUnviewedOnly
  - sortBy + sortOrder
- Ensure filter affects UI list AND export output.

5) TIMELINE: “VIEW FULL CALENDAR” MUST OPEN CALENDAR VIEW
- Add route /deal/:id/calendar (and investor-safe view)
- Wire button on Timeline page to navigate there
- Calendar shows month view + agenda list
- Key events highlighted (Launch, NDA deadline, IOI deadline, Commitment deadline, Allocation, Signing, Funding)
- Clicking event opens details
- Include “Download .ics” from calendar view

6) CLOSING CHECKLIST CLEANUP
- Remove any top-level “View” tab from Closing Checklist UI.
- Issuer/bookrunner can add checklist items + attach documents:
  - Use existing AddChecklistItemModal (already supports relatedDocumentId + upload click)
- Seed checklist based on Agreement Type (Unitranche/TLA/etc):
  - create base templates per agreement type and initialize on first load if checklist empty
