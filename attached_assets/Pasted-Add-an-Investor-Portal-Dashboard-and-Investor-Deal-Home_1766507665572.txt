Add an Investor Portal Dashboard and Investor Deal Home page that are lender-focused and work with existing auth/invitations/NDA/tier logic.

1) Add new investor-only routes:
- /investor              (Investor Dashboard)
- /investor/deal/:id     (Investor Deal Home)
These routes must require role=investor.

2) Investor Dashboard (/investor):
- Show ONLY deals the investor is invited to (use invitations/session.dealAccess).
- Render a table or cards with:
  Issuer/Sponsor, Borrower/Deal Name, Instrument, Launch Date,
  Next Deadline (NDA/IOI/Commitment), NDA Status, Access Tier,
  New Docs count, Open Q&A count, Action Required chips.
- Action chips should be computed:
  - “Sign NDA” if ndaRequired && !ndaSignedAt
  - “Review Docs” if any docs updated since lastViewedAt
  - “Submit Commitment” if within commitment window and no submission exists
  - “Q&A Response” if any investor questions have responses since lastSeen
- Clicking a deal navigates to /investor/deal/:id

3) Investor Deal Home (/investor/deal/:id):
- Show lender-safe deal summary (borrower, sector, instrument, size).
- Show lender timeline module with key dates (launch, NDA deadline, IOI deadline, commitment deadline, expected close).
- Show Notifications panel:
  - New/updated docs since last login
  - Q&A responses received
  - Deadline reminders
  - Requests (e.g., firm up) [stub ok]
- Show Quick Actions buttons:
  - Sign NDA (if needed)
  - Go to Documents (/deal/:id/documents)
  - Submit Commitment (/deal/:id/commitment)
  - Go to Q&A (/deal/:id/qa)

4) Navigation:
- For Investor role, update sidebar:
  - Replace “Dashboard” with “Investor Dashboard” linking to /investor
  - In deal workspace, keep: Docs, Q&A, Timeline, Submit Commitment
- Ensure investors cannot access issuer/bookrunner pages.

5) Data requirements:
- Use existing mock stores for invitations, doc metadata, doc views, Q&A, commitments.
- Add minimal derived selectors to compute:
  newDocsCount, openQACount, nextDeadlineLabel/date, actionRequired flags.

6) NDA gating:
- Investor Deal Home should show NDA status and allow signing.
- Documents/Commitment remain gated behind NDA if ndaRequired.

Keep styling consistent with current shadcn UI and Layout.
Ensure TypeScript compiles and no runtime errors.
