Implement real login + role-based navigation and data access for Issuer, Bookrunner, and Investor.

1) Create Auth context (client/src/context/auth.tsx):
- store session in localStorage: { role, userEmail, lenderId?, dealAccess? }
- provide login() / logout() / isAuthenticated

2) Add Login UI:
- Create /login page with role selector (Issuer, Bookrunner, Investor)
- For investor login require lenderId selection (dropdown seeded from mock lenders)
- On login redirect:
  - issuer/bookrunner -> /deals
  - investor -> /deals filtered by dealAccess OR /deal/:id/documents if only one deal

3) Add route guards:
- RequireAuth for all app routes except /login
- RequireRole for internal pages (issuer/bookrunner only):
  - /analytics, /deal/:id/overview, /deal/:id/book, /deal/:id/closing, /deal/:id/publish
- Investor can access only:
  - /deal/:id/documents
  - /deal/:id/qa
  - /deal/:id/timeline
  - /deal/:id/commitment (new page)

4) Update Layout sidebar to render items based on role:
- Issuer/Bookrunner: show full nav (Dashboard/Deals/Analytics/Messages + Deal workspace pages)
- Investor: show only Investor workspace pages:
  - Data Room & Docs
  - Due Diligence
  - Timeline
  - Submit Commitment

5) Investor-scoped VDR + markups:
- On Documents page for investor role: show fixed folders:
  Lender Presentation, Supplemental Info, KYC, Lender Paydown Model, Legal (read-only)
- Add Upload Markup button for Legal docs only (investor role).
- Store uploads in mock store keyed by (dealId, lenderId, documentId) and display upload history.

6) Investor-scoped Q&A:
- For investor role, show only questions where question.lenderId == session.lenderId
- Issuer/bookrunner sees all questions and can respond.

7) Timeline:
- For investor role show only launch + deadlines (no internal blockers).
- For issuer/bookrunner show full timeline with owners and blockers.

8) Create new Submit Commitment page:
- route /deal/:id/commitment
- investor can submit structured grid response (ticketMin/max, pricing, OID, fees, conditions, indicative/firm) + upload supporting docs.
- issuer/bookrunner can view all submissions aggregated (table).

Keep styling consistent with shadcn components and current layout.
Ensure TypeScript compiles and app runs.
