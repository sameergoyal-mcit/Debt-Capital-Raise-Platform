Implement role-aware unauthorized routing behavior AND add a friendly investor-safe fallback screen/message.

====================================================
PART 1 — ROLE-AWARE REDIRECTS (NO MORE “PAGE NOT AVAILABLE” FOR INVESTORS)
====================================================

GOAL:
If a user types a URL directly:
- Issuer/Bookrunner: allow if authorized, else redirect to /deals
- Investor: never show NotFound for restricted/internal pages; redirect to /investor or /investor/deal/:id

1) Create a shared helper:
- file: client/src/lib/auth-redirects.ts (or similar)
Export:
- getUnauthorizedRedirect(role): 
    investor -> "/investor"
    issuer/bookrunner -> "/deals"
- getInvestorDealRedirect(dealId): `/investor/deal/${dealId}`

2) Update all route guard components (ProtectedRoute / RequireAuth / RequireRole / InvestorOnly):
- Replace any “return <NotFound />” or “fall through to NotFound when unauthorized” with:
  - redirect to getUnauthorizedRedirect(role)
- If the URL is a /deal/:id/* path and the user is investor:
  - if dealId not in session.dealAccess -> redirect "/investor"
  - if dealId is allowed but route is non-investor-safe (overview/book/closing/analytics/publish/viewer) -> redirect `/investor/deal/${dealId}`

3) Preserve true 404 behavior:
- Only show NotFound when:
  - route does not exist AND user is authenticated
  - AND the URL is not a known restricted/internal route pattern
(So authorization failure is never treated as NotFound.)

4) Ensure investor-safe deal landing exists:
- /investor/deal/:id route must exist and work
- This becomes the redirect target when investor tries to access restricted deal pages

5) Add optional query param to pass a reason:
- Redirects for unauthorized access should include:
  ?reason=unauthorized
  and when redirecting from /deal/:id/* to investor deal home:
  ?reason=restricted&from=/deal/:id/overview

====================================================
PART 2 — FRIENDLY “NO ACCESS” MESSAGE (INVESTOR-SAFE FALLBACK UX)
====================================================

GOAL:
Instead of a silent redirect, show a friendly banner/toast explaining why the user was redirected.

1) Create a lightweight “Access Notice” component:
- file: client/src/components/access-notice.tsx
Behavior:
- Reads query params: reason and from
- If reason exists, display a shadcn Alert at top of page:
  - If reason=unauthorized: “You don’t have access to that page. Redirected to your dashboard.”
  - If reason=restricted: “That page is restricted. Redirected to your lender portal for this deal.”
  - Show optional “from” link text (not clickable is fine)

2) Display Access Notice on:
- /investor (Investor Dashboard)
- /investor/deal/:id (Investor Deal Home)
- /deals (Issuer/Bookrunner landing) optional

3) Ensure notice auto-dismisses:
- Either:
  - show for 6 seconds then hide
  - or allow manual close (X button)

4) (Optional) Also trigger a toast:
- If you already use toaster, trigger toast on redirect for immediate feedback.

====================================================
VALIDATION / EXPECTED RESULTS
====================================================

- Logged in as Investor:
  - visiting /deal/123/overview redirects to /investor/deal/123?reason=restricted&from=...
  - visiting /analytics redirects to /investor?reason=unauthorized&from=...
  - investor never sees “Page not available” for restricted internal pages
  - investor DOES see NotFound for truly invalid URLs like /asdfasdf

- Logged in as Issuer/Bookrunner:
  - normal access unchanged
  - unauthorized redirects go to /deals with a friendly message

Ensure TypeScript compiles and routing works in Replit.
