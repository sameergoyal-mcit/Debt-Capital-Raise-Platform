✅ 1. Clearly Show Deal Economics

For debt deals, issuers care about:

Target amount vs. committed / soft-circled amount

Pricing guidance / expected spread (e.g., SOFR + X)

Weighted average pricing from indications

Expected vs. achieved fees

Projected uses of debt proceeds

Add to Deal Overview UI:

A card or panel labeled “Debt Economics” with:

Target size

Committed amount with % progress

Spread range

OID (Original Issue Discount)

Fee guidance (Arrangement, Commitment)

Expected amortization schedule (if relevant)

✅ 2. Show Key Covenant Summary Up Front

Unlike equity, debt deals involve covenants. Issuers want quick visibility into:

Financial covenants (Leverage, Interest Coverage)

Incurrence tests

Maintenance tests

Restricted payments baskets

Add a “Covenant Preview” panel in overview that summarizes key financial tests.

✅ 3. Include Investor Engagement Metrics

For the issuer, understanding demand is essential. Add:

Investor engagement chart

NDA signed (%)

CIM downloads

Indications of Interest (IOIs)

Firm commitments

Investor type breakdown

CLOs vs. direct lenders vs. banks vs. insurance

This feedback helps issuers and the bookrunner adjust pricing and allocation strategy.

✅ 4. Show Real-Time Book Status

A static pipeline isn’t enough for debt deals—issuers want real-time traction:

Live book snapshot

Tickets by investor

Pricing bands selected

Pro-rata demand curves

Over/Under subscription alerts

Time to soft close / hard close countdown

A real-time interactive book status widget is helpful.

✅ 5. Link to Document Markups

Debt deals have heavy documentation:

Credit Agreement

Security documents

Intercreditor agreements

Ancillary compliance docs

Issuers need:

Latest redlines

Outstanding comments from lenders

Approval status by party

So make the Documents widget more prominent and contextually labeled — e.g., “Docs Requiring Issuer Review”.

✅ 6. Add “Actionable Alerts”

Debt deals are often timing-sensitive. Show:

Upcoming milestone deadlines

Pending issuer tasks

Finish covenant comps

Approve final pricing

Respond to lender requests

Escalation alerts (if book liquidity is slow)

Place this in a task panel on the right.

✅ 7. Put a “Deal Status Timeline” at the Top

Debt deals have well-defined stages:

Structuring

NDA execution

CIM delivery

Marketing

IOI collection

Bookbuilding

Allocation

Closing

A horizontal timeline with colored progress helps issuers visualize where they are.

✅ 8. Add Export / Report Buttons

Issuers often produce internal updates:

Export PDFs

Daily executive summary

Waterfall charts

Pricing sensitivity analysis

Add buttons like:

Export Deal Summary

Print Investor Engagement
