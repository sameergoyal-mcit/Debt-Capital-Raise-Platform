Perform a cleanup and correctness pass on the current codebase.

1) Fix Investor login redirect and deal access:
- In auth-context.tsx, after Investor login redirect to /investor (not /deal/:id/overview)
- Derive investor dealAccess from invitations via getLenderInvitations(lenderId) instead of hardcoding ["101"]

2) Fix Investor NDA CTA routing:
- In investor-deal-home.tsx change "Sign NDA Now" link to /deal/:id/documents so NDAGate handles signing
- Remove any links from investor views to /deal/:id/overview

3) Standardize NDA deadline logic:
- Add ndaDeadline?: string to Deal model OR implement a single helper getNdaDeadline(deal) using stageDueDates.NDA or launchDate+7 days
- Replace hardcoded NDA date strings (e.g. 2024-03-15) in investor-dashboard.tsx, investor-deal-home.tsx, investor-utils.ts
- Ensure ICS exports use the same deadline source

4) Fix investor-utils stats accuracy:
- newDocsCount must be based on docs visible to that lender (tier rules) AND updatedAt > lastViewedAt for that lender
- openQACount should reflect unanswered questions (e.g., status Open/Pending), not Answered
- add answeredSinceLastSeenCount if needed for notifications
- actionRequired should prioritize:
  Sign NDA > Submit Commitment (if inside window and not submitted) > Review Docs (new/updated) > Q&A response

5) Protect viewer routes:
- Wrap /deal/:id/viewer and /viewer/* routes in ProtectedRoute for issuer/bookrunner only OR remove them entirely
- Ensure no sensitive pages are reachable without auth

6) Layout polish:
- Replace hardcoded "Project Titan" in Layout with actual deal name looked up by dealId from mockDeals
- If unknown dealId, show "Deal Workspace"

7) Remove unused imports and dead code:
- Clean up login.tsx and any other pages with unused imports/variables
- Keep TypeScript lint clean

8) Centralize deadlines:
- Create lib/deal-deadlines.ts that returns a normalized list of deal milestones (launch, NDA, IOI, commitment, close)
- Reuse it in investor dashboard, investor deal home, ICS export, and digest generator

Ensure the app builds and runs in Replit with no runtime errors.
