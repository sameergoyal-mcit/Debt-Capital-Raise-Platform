I need to implement a "Deal Sandbox" with professional Financial Reporting standards. Please execute this specific 3-phase plan. 

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Do NOT make "Sandbox" a global sidebar item.
- It must be a new Tab named "Financial Model" inside the existing `DealOverview` page.
- The output must look like a 10-K Financial Statement (Grid format), not just charts.

PHASE 1: GRANULAR CREDIT ENGINE (server/lib/credit-engine.ts)
Refactor `runCreditModel` to accept year-by-year array inputs.
1. Update Input Interface `DealAssumptions`:
   - `revenue_growth`: number[] (Array of 5 percentages for Projected Years 1-5).
   - `ebitda_margins`: number[] (Array of 5 percentages).
   - `capex_percent`: number[] (Array of 5 percentages).
   - `adjustments`: number[] (Array of 5 currency values for one-off add-backs).
   - `tax_rate`: number.
   - `debt_structure`: { senior_amount: number, interest_rate: number, amort_rate: number }.
2. Logic Update:
   - Calculate `Gross EBITDA` = Revenue * Margin.
   - Calculate `Adj. EBITDA` = Gross EBITDA + Adjustments.
   - Calculate `FCF` = Adj. EBITDA - Interest - Tax - CapEx - Mandatory Amort.
   - Calculate `Ending Debt` = Beginning Debt - Mandatory Amort - Cash Sweep.
   - Calculate `DSCR` and `Leverage Ratio`.

PHASE 2: THE 10-K STYLE UI (client/src/components/deal-sandbox.tsx)
Create a component `DealSandbox` and embed it as a Tab in `client/src/pages/deal-overview.tsx`.
1. Split-Pane Layout:
   - **Left Pane (Inputs):** A "Spreadsheet-style" grid where users can type values for Growth %, Margins %, and Adjustments for Years 1-5.
   - **Right Pane (Outputs):** A standard Financial Reporting Table (The "10-K View").
2. The 10-K Table Structure:
   - Columns: `LTM (Actual)` | `Year 1` | `Year 2` | `Year 3` | `Year 4` | `Year 5`
   - Rows (Formatted exactly like this):
     - **Revenue** (Currency)
     - *% Growth* (Italicized, %)
     - **Gross EBITDA** (Currency)
     - *% Margin* (Italicized, %)
     - (+) Adjustments
     - **Adjusted EBITDA** (Bold, Currency)
     - (-) Depreciation & Amortization (Mocked or % of Rev)
     - **EBIT**
     - (-) Interest Expense
     - (-) Taxes
     - **Net Income**
     - (+) D&A Add-back
     - (-) CapEx
     - (-) Mandatory Debt Paydown
     - **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**
3. Visuals: Below the table, show a small line chart for "Leverage Evolution" (Net Debt / EBITDA).

PHASE 3: PUBLISH TO DATA ROOM
1. Add a "Publish Model" button in the Sandbox header.
2. When clicked:
   - Save the full state (all granular arrays) to a new table `deal_models`.
   - Create a record in `documents` with type `interactive_model`.
   - On the Investor Dashboard, clicking this document should open the `DealSandbox` in "Read-Only" mode.

Execute this now.
